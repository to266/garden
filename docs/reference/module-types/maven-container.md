# `maven-container` Module Type

## Description

A specialized version of the [container](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types/container) module type
that has special semantics for JAR files built with Maven.

Rather than build the JAR inside the container (or in a multi-stage build) this plugin runs `mvn package`
ahead of building the container, which tends to be much more performant, especially when building locally
with a warm artifact cache.

A default Dockerfile is also provided for convenience, but you may override it by including one in the module
directory.

To use it, make sure to add the `maven-container` provider to your project configuration.
The provider will automatically fetch and cache Maven and the appropriate OpenJDK version ahead of building.

Below is the full schema reference. For an introduction to configuring Garden modules, please look at our [Configuration
guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

`maven-container` modules also export values that are available in template strings. See the [Outputs](#outputs) section below for details.

## Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
# The schema version of this config (currently not used).
apiVersion: garden.io/v0

kind: Module

# The type of this module.
type:

# The name of this module.
name:

# Specify how to build the module. Note that plugins may define additional keys on this object.
build:
  # A list of modules that must be built before this module is built.
  dependencies:
    - # Module name to build ahead of this module.
      name:

      # Specify one or more files or directories to copy from the built dependency to this module.
      copy:
        - # POSIX-style path or filename of the directory or file(s) to copy to the target.
          source:

          # POSIX-style path or filename to copy the directory or file(s), relative to the build directory.
          # Defaults to to same as source path.
          target: ''

  # For multi-stage Dockerfiles, specify which image to build (see
  # https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-target-build-stage---target for details).
  targetImage:

  # Maximum time in seconds to wait for build to finish.
  timeout: 1200

# A description of the module.
description:

# Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules
# based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`).
# This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.
#
# Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also
# means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which
# case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).
#
# If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will
# automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's
# service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make
# sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
disabled: false

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that
# do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to
# filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
# tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files
# guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for
# details.
#
# Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.
include:

# Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these
# paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events,
# and when staging builds.
#
# Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include`
# field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration
# Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories)
# for details.
#
# Unlike the `modules.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and
# directories are watched for changes. Use the project `modules.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large
# directories that should not be watched for changes.
exclude:

# A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
# branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>
#
# Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local
# garden.yml file.
repositoryUrl:

# When false, disables pushing this module to remote registries.
allowPublish: true

# A list of files to write to the module directory when resolving this module. This is useful to automatically
# generate (and template) any supporting files needed for the module.
generateFiles:
  - # POSIX-style filename to read the source file contents from, relative to the path of the module (or the
    # ModuleTemplate configuration file if one is being applied).
    # This file may contain template strings, much like any other field in the configuration.
    sourcePath:

    # POSIX-style filename to write the resolved file contents to, relative to the path of the module source directory
    # (for remote modules this means the root of the module repository, otherwise the directory of the module
    # configuration).
    #
    # Note that any existing file with the same name will be overwritten. If the path contains one or more
    # directories, they will be automatically created if missing.
    targetPath:

    # The desired file contents as a string.
    value:

# A map of variables scoped to this particular module. These are resolved before any other parts of the module
# configuration and take precedence over project-scoped variables. They may reference project-scoped variables, and
# generally use any template strings normally allowed when resolving modules.
variables:

# Specify build arguments to use when building the container image.
#
# Note: Garden will always set a `GARDEN_MODULE_VERSION` argument with the module version at build time.
buildArgs: {}

# Specify extra flags to use when building the container image. Note that arguments may not be portable across
# implementations.
extraFlags:

# Specify the image name for the container. Should be a valid Docker image identifier. If specified and the module
# does not contain a Dockerfile, this image will be used to deploy services for this module. If specified and the
# module does contain a Dockerfile, this identifier is used when pushing the built image.
image:

# Specifies which files or directories to sync to which paths inside the running containers of hot reload-enabled
# services when those files or directories are modified. Applies to this module's services, and to services with this
# module as their `sourceModule`.
hotReload:
  # Specify one or more source files or directories to automatically sync into the running container.
  sync:
    - # POSIX-style path of the directory to sync to the target, relative to the module's top-level directory. Must be
      # a relative path. Defaults to the module's top-level directory if no value is provided.
      source: .

  postSyncCommand:

# POSIX-style name of Dockerfile, relative to module root.
dockerfile:

# A list of services to deploy from this container module.
services:
  - # Valid RFC1035/RFC1123 (DNS) label (may contain lowercase letters, numbers and dashes, must start with a letter,

| Type            | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[object]` | `[]`    | No       |

Example:

```yaml
build:
  ...
  dependencies:
    - name: some-other-module-name
```

### `build.dependencies[].name`

[build](#build) > [dependencies](#builddependencies) > name

Module name to build ahead of this module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | Yes      |

### `build.dependencies[].copy[]`

[build](#build) > [dependencies](#builddependencies) > copy

Specify one or more files or directories to copy from the built dependency to this module.

| Type            | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[object]` | `[]`    | No       |

### `build.dependencies[].copy[].source`

[build](#build) > [dependencies](#builddependencies) > [copy](#builddependenciescopy) > source

POSIX-style path or filename of the directory or file(s) to copy to the target.

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | Yes      |

### `build.dependencies[].copy[].target`

[build](#build) > [dependencies](#builddependencies) > [copy](#builddependenciescopy) > target

### `description`

A description of the module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `disabled`

Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).

If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `false` | No       |

### `include[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
include:
  - Dockerfile
  - my-app.js
```

### `exclude[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include` field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/using-garden/configuration-overview#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Unlike the `modules.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and directories are watched for changes. Use the project `modules.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that should not be watched for changes.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
exclude:
  - tmp/**/*
  - '*.log'
```

### `repositoryUrl`

A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>

Garden will import the repository source code into this module, but read the module's config from the local garden.yml file.

| Type              | Required |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| `gitUrl | string` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
repositoryUrl: "git+https://github.com/org/repo.git#v2.0"
```

### `allowPublish`

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | No       |

### `generateFiles[].targetPath`

[generateFiles](#generatefiles) > targetPath

POSIX-style filename to write the resolved file contents to, relative to the path of the module source directory (for remote modules this means the root of the module repository, otherwise the directory of the module configuration).

  sync:
    - source: "src"
```

### `hotReload.sync[].target`

[hotReload](#hotreload) > [sync](#hotreloadsync) > target

POSIX-style absolute path to sync the directory to inside the container. The root path (i.e. "/") is not allowed.

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | Yes      |

Example:

```yaml
hotReload:
  ...

| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[string]` | `[]`    | No       |

### `services[].disabled`

[services](#services) > disabled

Set this to `true` to disable the service. You can use this with conditional template strings to enable/disable services based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `enabled: \${environment.name != "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain services for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a service means that it will not be deployed, and will also be ignored if it is declared as a runtime dependency for another service, test or task.

Note however that template strings referencing the service's outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the service is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

When using the Kubernetes provider, these annotations are applied to both Service and Pod resources. You can generally specify the annotations intended for both Pods or Services here, and the ones that don't apply on either side will be ignored (i.e. if you put a Service annotation here, it'll also appear on Pod specs but will be safely ignored there, and vice versa).

| Type     | Default | Required |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| `object` | `{}`    | No       |

List of volumes that should be mounted when deploying the task.

Note: If neither `hostPath` nor `module` is specified, an empty ephemeral volume is created and mounted when deploying the container.

| Type            | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[object]` | `[]`    | No       |

### `tasks[].volumes[].name`

[tasks](#tasks) > [volumes](#tasksvolumes) > name

The name of the allocated volume.

| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | Yes      |

### `tasks[].volumes[].hostPath`

[tasks](#tasks) > [volumes](#tasksvolumes) > hostPath

_NOTE: Usage of hostPath is generally discouraged, since it doesn't work reliably across different platforms
and providers. Some providers may not support it at all._

A local path or path on the node that's running the container, to mount in the container, relative to the
module source path (or absolute).

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - volumes:
      - hostPath: "/some/dir"
```

### `tasks[].volumes[].module`

[tasks](#tasks) > [volumes](#tasksvolumes) > module

The name of a _volume module_ that should be mounted at `containerPath`. The supported module types will depend on which provider you are using. The `kubernetes` provider supports the [persistentvolumeclaim module](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types/persistentvolumeclaim), for example.

When a `module` is specified, the referenced module/volume will be automatically configured as a runtime dependency of this service, as well as a build dependency of this module.

Note: Make sure to pay attention to the supported `accessModes` of the referenced volume. Unless it supports the ReadWriteMany access mode, you'll need to make sure it is not configured to be mounted by multiple services at the same time. Refer to the documentation of the module type in question to learn more.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

### `imageVersion`

Set this to override the default OpenJDK container image version. Make sure the image version matches the
configured `jdkVersion`. Ignored if you provide your own Dockerfile.

| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
imageVersion: "11-jdk"
```

### `jarPath`

POSIX-style path to the packaged JAR artifact, relative to the module directory.

| Type        | Required |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `posixPath` | Yes      |

Example:

```yaml
jarPath: "target/my-module.jar"
```

### `jdkVersion`

The JDK version to use.

| Type     | Default | Required |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| `number` | `8`     | No       |

### `mvnOpts[]`

Options to add to the `mvn package` command when building.

| Type            | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `array[string]` | `[]`    | No       |

### `useDefaultDockerfile`

Use the default Dockerfile provided with this module. If set to `false` and no Dockerfile is found, Garden will fallback to using the `image` field.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true`  | No       |
