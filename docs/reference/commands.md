## Garden CLI commands

Below is a list of Garden CLI commands and usage information.

The commands should be run in a Garden project, and are always scoped to that project.

Note: You can get a list of commands in the CLI by running `garden -h/--help`,
and detailed help for each command using `garden <command> -h/--help`

The _Outputs_ sections show the output structure when running the command with `--output yaml`. The same structure is used when `--output json` is used and when querying through the REST API, but in JSON format.

##### Global options

The following option flags can be used with any of the CLI commands:

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--root` | `-r` | path | Override project root directory (defaults to working directory). Can be absolute or relative to current directory.
  | `--silent` | `-s` | boolean | Suppress log output. Same as setting --logger-type&#x3D;quiet.
  | `--env` | `-e` | string | The environment (and optionally namespace) to work against.
  | `--logger-type` |  | `quiet` `basic` `fancy` `fullscreen` `json`  | Set logger type. fancy updates log lines in-place when their status changes (e.g. when tasks complete), basic appends a new log line when a log line&#x27;s status changes, json same as basic, but renders log lines as JSON, quiet suppresses all log output, same as --silent.
  | `--log-level` | `-l` | `error` `warn` `info` `verbose` `debug` `silly` `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5`  | Set logger level. Values can be either string or numeric and are prioritized from 0 to 5 (highest to lowest) as follows: error: 0, warn: 1, info: 2, verbose: 3, debug: 4, silly: 5.
  | `--output` | `-o` | `json` `yaml`  | Output command result in specified format (note: disables progress logging and interactive functionality).
  | `--emoji` |  | boolean | Enable emoji in output (defaults to true if the environment supports it).
  | `--show-timestamps` |  | boolean | Show timestamps with log output. When enabled, Garden will use the basic logger. I.e., log status changes are rendered as new lines instead of being updated in-place.
  | `--yes` | `-y` | boolean | Automatically approve any yes/no prompts during execution.
  | `--force-refresh` |  | boolean | Force refresh of any caches, e.g. cached provider statuses.
  | `--var` |  | array:string | Set a specific variable value, using the format &lt;key&gt;&#x3D;&lt;value&gt;, e.g. &#x60;--var some-key&#x3D;custom-value&#x60;. This will override any value set in your project configuration. You can specify multiple variables by separating with a comma, e.g. &#x60;--var key-a&#x3D;foo,key-b&#x3D;&quot;value with quotes&quot;&#x60;.
  | `--version` | `-v` | boolean | Show the current CLI version.
  | `--help` | `-h` | boolean | Show help
  | `--disable-port-forwards` |  | boolean | Disable automatic port forwarding when in watch/hot-reload mode. Note that you can also set GARDEN_DISABLE_PORT_FORWARDS&#x3D;true in your environment.

### garden build

**Build your modules.**

Builds all or specified modules, taking into account build dependency order.
Optionally stays running and automatically builds modules if their source (or their dependencies' sources) change.

Examples:

    garden build            # build all modules in the project
    garden build my-module  # only build my-module
    garden build --force    # force rebuild of modules
    garden build --watch    # watch for changes to code

### garden delete service

**Deletes running services.**

Deletes (i.e. un-deploys) the specified services. Deletes all services in the project if no arguments are provided.
Note that this command does not take into account any services depending on the deleted service/services, and might
therefore leave the project in an unstable state. Running `garden deploy` will re-deploy any missing services.

Examples:

    garden delete service my-service # deletes my-service
    garden delete service            # deletes all deployed services in the project

| Supported in workflows |   |

### garden deploy

**Deploy service(s) to your environment.**

Deploys all or specified services, taking into account service dependency order.
Also builds modules and dependencies if needed.

Optionally stays running and automatically re-builds and re-deploys services if their module source
(or their dependencies' sources) change.

Examples:

    garden deploy                      # deploy all modules in the project
    garden deploy my-service           # only deploy my-service
    garden deploy service-a,service-b  # only deploy service-a and service-b
    garden deploy --force              # force re-deploy of modules, even if they're already deployed
    garden deploy --watch              # watch for changes to code
    garden deploy --dev=my-service     # deploys all services, with dev mode enabled for my-service
    garden deploy --dev                # deploys all compatible services with dev mode enabled
    garden deploy --env stage          # deploy your services to an environment called stage
    garden deploy --skip service-b     # deploy all services except service-b

### garden dev

**Starts the garden development console.**

The Garden dev console is a combination of the `build`, `deploy` and `test` commands.
It builds, deploys and tests all your modules and services, and re-builds, re-deploys and re-tests
as you modify the code.

Examples:

    garden dev
    garden dev --hot=foo-service,bar-service  # enable hot reloading for foo-service and bar-service
    garden dev --hot=*                        # enable hot reloading for all compatible services
    garden dev --skip-tests=                  # skip running any tests
    garden dev --name integ                   # run all tests with the name 'integ' in the project
    garden test --name integ*                 # run all tests with the name starting with 'integ' in the project

    # If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden
    # will automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the
    # module's service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you

After linking a remote source, Garden will read it from its local directory instead of
from the remote URL. Garden can only link remote sources that have been declared in the project
level `garden.yml` config.

Examples:

    garden link source my-source path/to/my-source # links my-source to its local version at the given path

| Supported in workflows |   |
| ---------------------- |---|
| Yes |                                                  |

#### Usage

    garden link source <source> <path> 

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `source` | Yes | Name of the source to link as declared in the project config.
  | `path` | Yes | Path to the local directory that contains the source.


#### Outputs

```yaml
# A list of all locally linked external sources.
sources:
  - # The name of the linked source.
    name:

    # The local directory path of the linked repo clone.
    path:
```

### garden link module

**Link a module to a local directory.**

After linking a remote module, Garden will read the source from the module's local directory instead of from
the remote URL. Garden can only link modules that have a remote source,
i.e. modules that specifiy a `repositoryUrl` in their `garden.yml` config file.

Examples:

    garden link module my-module path/to/my-module # links my-module to its local version at the given path

| Supported in workflows |   |
| ---------------------- |---|
| Yes |                                                  |

#### Usage

    garden link module <module> <path> 

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `module` | Yes | Name of the module to link.
  | `path` | Yes | Path to the local directory that contains the module.


#### Outputs

```yaml
# A list of all locally linked external modules.
sources:
  - # The name of the linked module.
    name:

    # The local directory path of the linked repo clone.
    path:
```

### garden logs

**Retrieves the most recent logs for the specified service(s).**

Outputs logs for all or specified services, and optionally waits for news logs to come in. Defaults
to getting logs from the last minute when in `--follow` mode. You can change this with the `--since` option.

Examples:

    garden logs                       # interleaves color-coded logs from all services (up to a certain limit)
    garden logs --since 2d            # interleaves color-coded logs from all services from the last 2 days
    garden logs --tail 100            # interleaves the last 100 log lines from all services
    garden logs service-a,service-b   # interleaves color-coded logs for service-a and service-b
    garden logs --follow              # keeps running and streams all incoming logs to the console
    garden logs --original-color      # interleaves logs from all services and prints the original output color

| Supported in workflows |   |
| ---------------------- |---|
| No |                                                  |

  | `--tail` | `-t` | number | Number of lines to show for each service. Defaults to showing all log lines (up to a certain limit). Takes precedence over
the &#x60;--since&#x60; flag if both are set. Note that we don&#x27;t recommend using a large value here when in follow mode.
  | `--show-container` |  | boolean | Show the name of the container with log output. May not apply to all providers
  | `--timestamps` |  | boolean | Show timestamps with log output.
  | `--since` |  | moment | Only show logs newer than a relative duration like 5s, 2m, or 3h. Defaults to &#x60;&quot;1m&quot;&#x60; when &#x60;--follow&#x60; is true
unless &#x60;--tail&#x60; is set. Note that we don&#x27;t recommend using a large value here when in follow mode.
  | `--original-color` |  | boolean | Show the original color output of the logs instead of color coding them.
  | `--hide-service` |  | boolean | Hide the service name and render the logs directly.


### garden migrate

**Migrate `garden.yml` configuration files to version 0.12**

Scans the project for `garden.yml` configuration files and updates those that are not compatible with version 0.12.
By default the command prints the updated versions to the terminal. You can optionally update the files in place with the `write` flag.

Note: This command does not validate the configs per se. It will simply try to convert a given configuration file so that
it is compatible with version 0.12 or greater, regardless of whether that file was ever a valid Garden config. It is therefore
recommended that this is used on existing `garden.yml` files that were valid in version v0.10.x.

Examples:

    garden migrate              # scans all garden.yml files and prints the updated versions along with the paths to them.
    garden migrate --write      # scans all garden.yml files and overwrites them with the updated versions.
    garden migrate ./garden.yml # scans the provided garden.yml file and prints the updated version.

| Supported in workflows |   |
| ---------------------- |---|
| No |                                                  |

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |

#### Options

| Argument | Alias | Type | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--write` |  | boolean | Update the &#x60;garden.yml&#x60; in place.

### garden publish

**Build and publish module(s) (e.g. container images) to a remote registry.**

Publishes built module artifacts for all or specified modules.
Also builds modules and build dependencies if needed.

By default the artifacts/images are tagged with the Garden module version, but you can also specify the `--tag` option to specify a specific string tag _or_ a templated tag. Any template values that can be used on the module being tagged are available, in addition to ${module.name}, ${module.version} and ${module.hash} tags that allows referencing the name of the module being tagged, as well as its Garden version. ${module.version} includes the "v-" prefix normally used for Garden versions, and ${module.hash} doesn't.

Examples:

    garden publish                # publish artifacts for all modules in the project
    garden publish my-container   # only publish my-container
    garden publish --force-build  # force re-build of modules before publishing artifacts
    garden publish --allow-dirty  # allow publishing dirty builds (which by default triggers error)

    # Publish my-container with a tag of v0.1
    garden publish my-container --tag "v0.1"

    # Publish my-container with a tag of v1.2-<hash> (e.g. v1.2-abcdef123)
    garden publish my-container --tag "v1.2-${module.hash}"

| Supported in workflows |   |

| -------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `--force-build` |  | boolean | Force rebuild of module(s) before publishing.
  | `--allow-dirty` |  | boolean | Allow publishing dirty builds (with untracked/uncommitted changes).
  | `--tag` |  | string | Override the tag on the built artifacts. You can use the same sorts of template strings as when templating values in module configs, with the addition of ${module.*} tags, allowing you to reference the name and Garden version of the module being tagged.

### garden test

**Test all or specified modules.**

Runs all or specified tests defined in the project. Also builds modules and dependencies,
and deploys service dependencies if needed.

Optionally stays running and automatically re-runs tests if their module source
(or their dependencies' sources) change.

Examples:

    garden test                   # run all tests in the project
    garden test my-module         # run all tests in the my-module module
    garden test --name integ      # run all tests with the name 'integ' in the project
    garden test --name integ*     # run all tests with the name starting with 'integ' in the project
    garden test -n unit -n lint   # run all tests called either 'unit' or 'lint' in the project
    garden test --force           # force tests to be re-run, even if they've already run successfully
    garden test --watch           # watch for changes to code

### garden tools

**Access tools included by providers.**

Run a tool defined by a provider in your project, downloading and extracting it if necessary. Run without arguments to get a list of all tools available.

Run with the --get-path flag to just print the path to the binary or library directory (depending on the tool type). If the tool is a non-executable library, this flag is implicit.

When multiple plugins provide a tool with the same name, you can choose a specific plugin/version by specifying <plugin name>.<tool name>, instead of just <tool name>. This is generally advisable when using this command in scripts, to avoid accidental conflicts.

When there are name conflicts and a plugin name is not specified, we first prefer tools defined by configured providers in the current project (if applicable), and then alphabetical by plugin name.

Examples:

    # Run kubectl with <args>.
    garden tools kubectl -- <args>

    # Run the kubectl version defined specifically by the `kubernetes` plugin.
    garden tools kubernetes.kubectl -- <args>

    # Print the path to the kubernetes.kubectl tool to stdout, instead of running it.
    garden tools kubernetes.kubectl --get-path

    # List all available tools.
    garden tools
