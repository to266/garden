# Helm Charts

The [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager is one of the most commonly used tools for managing Kubernetes manifests. Garden supports using your own Helm charts, alongside your container modules, via the `kubernetes` and `local-kubernetes` providers. This guide shows you how to configure and use 3rd-party (or otherwise external) Helm charts, as well as your own charts in your Garden project. We also go through how to set up tests, tasks and hot-reloading for your charts.

In this guide we'll be using the [vote-helm](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/0.12.25/examples/vote-helm) project. If you prefer to just check out a complete example, the project itself is also a good resource.

You may also want to check out the full [helm module reference](../reference/module-types/helm.md).

_Note: If you only need a way to deploy some Kubernetes manifests and don't need all the features of Helm, you can_
_use the simpler `kubernetes` module type instead. Check out the_
_[kubernetes-module](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/0.12.25/examples/kubernetes-module) example for more info._

## Basics

First off, a couple of things to note on how the Helm support is implemented, with respect to Garden primitives:

1) One `helm` _module_ maps to a single Garden _service_ (not to be confused with Kubernetes Service resources), with the same name as the module.
2) Because a Helm chart only contains manifests and not actual code (i.e. your containers/images), you'll often need to make two Garden modules for a single deployed service, e.g. one `container` module for your image, and then the `helm` module that references it.

## Referencing external charts

Using external charts, where the chart sources are not located in your own project, can be quite straightforward. At a
minimum, you just need to point to the chart, and perhaps provide some values as inputs. Here is the `redis` module from
our example project, for example:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Redis service for queueing votes before they are aggregated
type: helm
name: redis
repo: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
chart: redis
version: "10.5.7"
values:
  usePassword: false
```

For a simple setup, this may be all you need for a chart to be deployed with the rest of your stack. You can also list `redis` as a dependency of one of your other services, and this Helm chart is automatically deployed ahead of it, in dependency order.

You may also add a `repo` field, to reference a specific chart repository. This may be useful if you run your own chart repository for your organization, or are referencing a module that isn't contained in the default Helm repo.

## Local charts

Instead of fetching the chart sources from another repository, you'll often want to include your chart sources in your Garden project. To do this, you can simply add a `garden.yml` in your chart directory (next to your `Chart.yaml`) and start by giving it a name:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Helm chart for my module
type: helm
name: my-module
```

You can also use Garden's external repository support, to reference chart sources in another repo:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Helm chart for my module
type: helm
name: my-module
repositoryUrl: https://github.com/my-org/my-helm-chart#v0.1
```

## Tasks and tests

You may also want to define _tests_ and/or _tasks_ that execute in one of the containers defined in the chart. An example of this is how we define tasks in the `vote-helm/postgres` module:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Postgres database for storing voting results
type: helm
name: postgres
chart: stable/postgresql
version: 3.9.2    # the chart version to fetch
serviceResource:
  kind: StatefulSet
  name: postgres
tasks:
  - name: db-init
    args: [ psql, -w, -U, postgres, ..., -c, "'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS votes ..." ]
    env:
      PGPASSWORD: postgres
    dependencies:
      - postgres
  - name: db-clear
    args: [ psql, -w, -U, postgres, ..., -c, "'TRUNCATE votes'" ]
    env:
      PGPASSWORD: postgres
    dependencies:
      - postgres
```

Note first the `serviceResource` field. This tells Garden which Kubernetes _Deployment_, _DaemonSet_ or _StatefulSet_ to regard as the primary resource of the chart. In this case, it is simply the `postgres` application itself. When running the `db-init` and `db-clear` tasks, Garden will find the appropriate container spec in the chart based on the `serviceResource` spec, and then execute that container with the task's `args` and (optionally) the specified `env` variables.

The same applies to any _tests_ that you specify. Take for example the `vote` module:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Helm chart for the voting UI
type: helm
name: vote
serviceResource:
  kind: Deployment
...
tests:
  - name: integ
    args: [npm, run, test:integ]
    dependencies:
      - api
```

Instead of the top-level `serviceResource` you can also add a `resource` field with the same schema to any individual task or test specification. This can be useful if you have different containers in the chart that you want to use for different scenarios.

## Providing values to the Helm chart

In most cases you'll need to provide some parameters to the Helm chart you're using. The simplest way to do this is via the `values`field:

```yaml
kind: Module
type: helm
name: my-helm-module
...
values:
  some:
    key: some-value
```

This will effectively create a new YAML with the supplied values and pass it to Helm when rendering/deploying the chart. This is particularly handy when you want to template in the values (see the next section for a good example).

You can also provide you own value files, which will work much the same way. You just need to list the paths to them (relative to the module root, i.e. the directory containing the `garden.yml` file) and they will be supplied to Helm when rendering/deploying. For example:

```yaml
# garden.yml
kind: Module
type: helm
name: my-helm-module
...
valueFiles:
  - values.default.yaml
  - values.${environment.name}.yaml
```

```yaml
# values.default.yaml
some:
  key: default-value
other:
  key: other-default
```

```yaml
# values.prod.yaml
some:
  key: prod-value
```

In this example, `some.key` is set to `"prod-value"` for the `prod` environment, and `other.key` maintains the default value set in `values.default.yaml`.

If you also set the `values` field in the Module configuration, the values there take precedence over both of the value files.

## Linking container modules and Helm modules

When your project also contains one or more `container` modules that build the images used by a `helm` module, you want to make sure the `container`s are built ahead of deploying the Helm chart, and that the correct image tag is used when deploying. The `vote-helm/worker` module and the corresponding `worker-image` module provide a simple example:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Helm chart for the worker container
type: helm
name: worker
...
build:
  dependencies: [worker-image]
values:
  image:
    tag: ${modules.worker-image.version}
```

```yaml
kind: Module
description: The worker that collects votes and stores results in a postgres table
type: container
name: worker-image
```

Here the `worker` module specifies the image as a build dependency, and additionally injects the `worker-image` version into the Helm chart via the `values` field. Note that the shape of the chart's `values.yaml` file will dictate how exactly you provide the image version/tag to the chart (this example is based on the default template generated by `helm create`), so be sure to consult the reference for the chart in question.

Notice that this can also work if you have multiple containers in a single chart. You just add them all as build dependencies, and the appropriate reference under `values`.

## Hot reloading

When your project contains the `container` module referenced by a `helm` module, you can even use Garden's [hot-reloading](./hot-reload.md) feature for a Helm chart. Going back to the `vote` module example:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Helm chart for the voting UI
type: helm
name: vote
serviceResource:
  kind: Deployment
  containerModule: vote-image       # The name of your container module.
  hotReloadArgs: [npm, run, serve]  # Arguments to override the default arguments in the resource's container.
...
```

For hot-reloading to work you must specify `serviceResource.containerModule`, so that Garden knows which module contains the sources to use for hot-reloading. You can then optionally add `serviceResource.hotReloadArgs` to, for example, start the container with automatic reloading or in development mode.

For the above example, you could then run `garden deploy -w --hot-reload=vote` or `garden dev --hot-reload=vote` to start the `vote` service in hot-reloading mode. When you then change the sources in the _vote-image_ module, Garden syncs the changes to the running container from the Helm chart.

## Re-using charts

Often you'll want to re-use the same Helm charts for multiple modules. For example, you might have a generic template
for all your backend services that configures auto-scaling, secrets/keys, sidecars, routing and so forth, and you don't
want to repeat those configurations all over the place.

You can achieve this by using the `base` field on the `helm` module type. Staying with our `vote-helm` example project,
let's look at the `base-chart` and `api` modules:

```yaml
# base-chart
kind: Module
description: Base Helm chart for services
type: helm
name: base-chart
serviceResource:
  kind: Deployment
skipDeploy: true
```

```yaml
# api
kind: Module
description: The API backend for the voting UI
type: helm
name: api
base: base-chart
serviceResource:
  containerModule: api-image
dependencies:
  - redis
values:
  name: api
  image:
    repository: api-image
    tag: ${modules.api-image.version}
```

Here, the `base-chart` module contains the actual Helm chart and templates. Note the `skipDeploy` flag, which we set
because the module should only be used as a base chart in this case.

The `api` module only contains the `garden.yml` file, but configures the base chart using the `values` field, and also
sets its own dependencies (those are not inherited) and specifies its `serviceResource.containerModule`.

In our base chart, we make certain values like `name`, `image.repository` and `image.tag` required (using the
[required](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/)
helper function) in order to enforce correct usage. We recommend enforcing constraints like that, so that mistakes
can be caught quickly.

The `result` module also uses the same base chart, but sets different values and metadata:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: Helm chart for the results UI
type: helm
name: result
base: base-chart
serviceResource:
  containerModule: result-image
  hotReloadArgs: [nodemon, server.js]
dependencies:
  - db-init
values:
  name: result
  image:
    repository: result-image
    tag: ${modules.result-image.version}
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    paths: [/]
    hosts: [result-helm.local.app.garden]
tests:
  - name: integ
    args: [echo, ok]
    dependencies:
      - db-init
```

This pattern can be quite powerful, and can be used to share common templates across your organization. You could
even have an organization-wide repository of base charts for different purposes, and link it in your project config
with something like this:

```yaml
kind: Project
sources:
  - name: base-charts
    repositoryUrl: https://github.com/my-org/helm-base-charts.git#v0.1.0
...
```

The base chart can also be any `helm` module (not just "base" charts specifically made for that purpose), so you have
a lot of flexibility in how you organize your charts.

## Production environments

You can define a remote environment as a `production` environment by setting the [production flag](../reference/project-config.md#environmentsproduction) to `true`. This affects some default behavior when deploying `helm`  modules. See the [Deploying to production](./remote-kubernetes.md#deploying-to-production) section in the [Remote Kubernetes](./remote-kubernetes.md) guide for details.
