# Local mode for `helm` modules

A very basic demo project for Garden [local mode](../../docs/guides/running-service-in-local-mode.md) for `helm`
module type.

This project is based on the [local-mode-k8s](../local-mode-k8s). The only difference is that this one has the `backend`
service defined as a `helm` module. The backend service can be started in the _local mode_.

The local backend service implementation can be found in [backend-local](./backend-local).

To build the local backend service, locate to its directory and run the following commands:

```shell
# optional command to re-generate `main.mod` file
go mod init main
# build binary
go build -o main
# make the binary executable
chmod +x main
```

To start the backend in local mode, try the following commands:

```shell
# To start a specific service in local mode
garden deploy --local=backend

# To start both services in local mode
garden deploy --local
garden deploy --local=*
```

Alternatively, you can also run the local mode using the `garden dev` command:

```shell
# To start a specific service in local mode
garden dev --local=backend

# To start both services in local mode
garden dev --local
garden dev --local=*
```

To verify the result, call the corresponding ingress URLs of the `frontend` and `backend` applications. The local
backend implementation returns a different message in a response.
