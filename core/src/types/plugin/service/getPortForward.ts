    Create a port forward tunnel to the specified service and port. When \`getServiceStatus\` returns one or more
    \`forwardablePort\` specs, the Garden service creates an open port. When connections are made to that port,
    this handler is called to create a tunnel, and the connection (and any subsequent connections) is forwarded to
    the tunnel.

    The tunnel should be persistent. If the tunnel stops listening to connections, this handler will be called again.

    If there is a corresponding \`stopPortForward\` handler, it is called when cleaning up.
