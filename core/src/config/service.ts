          Set this to \`true\` to disable the service. You can use this with conditional template strings to enable/disable services based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. \`enabled: \${environment.name != "prod"}\`). This can be handy when you only need certain services for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

          Disabling a service means that it will not be deployed, and will also be ignored if it is declared as a runtime dependency for another service, test or task.

          Note however that template strings referencing the service's outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the service is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
