    To help us make Garden better, you can opt in to the collection of usage data.
    We make sure all the data collected is anonymized and stripped of sensitive
    information. We collect data about which commands are run, what tasks they trigger,
    which API calls are made to your local Garden server, as well as some info
    about the environment in which Garden runs.

    You will be asked if you want to opt-in when running Garden for the
    first time and you can use this command to update your preferences later.

    Examples:

        garden config analytics-enabled true   # enable analytics
        garden config analytics-enabled false  # disable analytics
  `

  // Skip printing header
  printHeader() {}

  async action({ garden, log, args }: CommandParams<Args>): Promise<CommandResult> {
    const analyticsClient = await AnalyticsHandler.init(garden, log)
    await analyticsClient.setAnalyticsOptIn(args.enable)

    if (args.enable) {
      log.setSuccess(`Thanks for helping us make Garden better! Anonymized analytics collection is now active.`)
    } else {
      log.setSuccess(`The collection of anonymous CLI usage data is now disabled.`)
    }

    return {}
  }
}
